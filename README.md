It's a single page application that uses fetch to request images from the NASA Open API APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day - apod.nasa.gov/apod/archivepix.html) and shows them to the user in a simple navigation way. 
The data it's stored in a map so each image is requested only once.

To use the API you can use the demo key or generate your own in the site https://api.nasa.gov/
The key has to be in the file .env
REACT_APP_APOD_API_KEY=DEMO_KEY
